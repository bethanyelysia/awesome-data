## README

The [Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2) (SARS-CoV-2) has had a worldwide effect. The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 declared COVID-19 ([Coronavirus disease 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019)) a pandemic, pointing to the over 118,000 cases of the coronavirus illness in over 110 countries and territories around the world at the time. 

This dataset provides time series data tracking the number of people affected by COVID-19 worldwide, including:

- confirmed tested cases of Coronavirus infection
- how many have reportedly died while sick with Coronavirus
- the number of people who have reportedly recovered from it

## Data

The [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://systems.jhu.edu/) (CSSE) has been doing a great public service from an early point by sharing data on the epidemic on the [CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) repository.

This Data Package is currently updated daily from there. 

## Preparation

We have normalized data a bit - unpivoted and transfered dates to be more machine readable.

This repository uses [dataflows](https://github.com/datahq/dataflows) to process and normalize the data. Install `dataflows`, so you can run the update with:

```
python process.py
```
